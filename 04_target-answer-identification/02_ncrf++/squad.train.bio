A O
reduction B-ANSWER
is O
a O
transformation O
of O
one O

It O
captures O
the O
informal O
notion O
of O

For O

we O

reduces B-ANSWER

The O

This O

that O
the B-ANSWER

For O
example O
, O
the O
problem O

can O
be O
reduced O
to B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER

This O
means O
an O

can O
be O
used O
to O
square O
an O

Indeed O

this O

done O
by O
giving O
the O

input B-ANSWER

both O

Thus O
we O
see O
that O
squaring B-ANSWER
is O
not O
more O
difficult O

multiplication O
, O
since O
squaring O
can O
be O
reduced O
to O

This O
motivates O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
problem O

A O
problem O
X O
is O

for O
a O
class O
of O
problems O
C O
if O
every O

be O
reduced O

X. O

Thus O
no B-ANSWER
problem I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
C I-ANSWER
is I-ANSWER
harder I-ANSWER

X I-ANSWER
, O
since O
an O

allows O

to O
solve O
any O

Of O
course O

the O
notion O

depends O
on O

If O

, O
then B-ANSWER
X I-ANSWER
is I-ANSWER
said I-ANSWER

This O
means O
that O

the O
hardest O

C. O
( O
Since O

Thus O

a O

named O
Mr O

refused O

, O
as O
a O
protest O
against O
the O

He O
claimed O
the O
Italian O

The B-ANSWER
Italian I-ANSWER

opinion O

By O
contrast O
, O
the B-ANSWER
Court I-ANSWER

held O
that O
ultimately O
the O

However O
, O
in O
principle O

Mr O

was O
entitled O

plead O
that O
the O

the O

The O

the O

while O
all O

recognise O
that O

takes O
primacy O
over O

where O
this O
agreed O

they O
do O
not O
accept O
that O
the O

In O
the O
United O

the O

that O

entirely O

so O
" O
it O
has O
always O

that O

The O
view O
of O
the O
German O
Constitutional O
Court O
from O
the O
Solange O
I O
and O
Solange O
II O
decisions O
is O
that O
if B-ANSWER

not I-ANSWER
comply I-ANSWER
with I-ANSWER
its I-ANSWER
basic I-ANSWER
constitutional I-ANSWER
rights I-ANSWER

the B-ANSWER

then I-ANSWER
it I-ANSWER
can I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
override I-ANSWER
German I-ANSWER

. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
nicknames O

go O
, O
" O
so O
long O
as O
" O
the O
EU O
works O
towards O
the O
democratisation O
of O
its O
institutions O
, O
and O
has O
a O
framework O
that O
protects O
fundamental O
human O
rights O
, O
it O
would O
not O
review O

for O
compatibility O
with O
German O
constitutional O
principles O
. O

Most O
other O

have O
expressed O
similar O
reservations O

This O
suggests O
the O
EU O

legitimacy O
rests O
on O
the B-ANSWER
ultimate I-ANSWER
authority I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER

its I-ANSWER
factual I-ANSWER

While O
constitutional B-ANSWER
law I-ANSWER
concerns O
the O
European O

governance O

administrative B-ANSWER
law I-ANSWER
binds O
EU O

Both O

of O
the O

From O
the O
EU O
's O
foundation O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
also O
held O
that O
the O

allowed O
citizens O

to O
bring O
claims O
against O
EU O
and O
member O
state O
institutions O
for O
violation O

the O

, O
if O

However O
, O
under O

1986 B-ANSWER
to O
not O
be O
allowed O

This O
meant O
courts B-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
member I-ANSWER

were O
not O
bound O
to O
apply O
an O
EU O
law O
where O
a O

even O

if O
it O

an O

on O
another O

These O
rules O
on O

limit O
the O

All B-ANSWER

The O
remedy O
for O
a O

where O
there O
has O
been O
a O
breach O

to O
apply O
higher O
standards O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
Working B-ANSWER
Time I-ANSWER
Directive I-ANSWER
requires O
that O
every O
worker O
has O
at O
least O
4 B-ANSWER
weeks I-ANSWER
paid I-ANSWER
holidays I-ANSWER
each I-ANSWER
year I-ANSWER
, O
but O
most O
member O
states O
require O
more B-ANSWER
than I-ANSWER
28 I-ANSWER
days I-ANSWER
in O
national O
law O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
current O
position O
adopted O
by O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
citizens O
have O
standing O
to O
make O
claims O
based O
on O
national O
laws O
that O
implement O
Directives O
, O
but O
not O
from O
Directives O
themselves O
. O

Directives O
do O
not O
have O
so O
called O
" O
horizontal O
" O
direct O
effect O
( O
i.e. O
between O
non O
- O
state O
parties O
) O
. O

This O
view O
was O
instantly O
controversial O
, O
and O
in O
the B-ANSWER
early I-ANSWER
1990s I-ANSWER
three O
Advocate O
Generals O
persuasively O
argued O
that O
Directives O
should O
create O
rights O
and O
duties O
for O
all O
citizens O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
refused O
, O
but O
there O
are O
five O
large O
exceptions O
. O

First O
, O
if O
a O
Directive O
's O
deadline O
for O
implementation O
is O
not O
met O
, O
the B-ANSWER
member I-ANSWER
state I-ANSWER
can I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
enforce I-ANSWER
conflicting I-ANSWER
laws I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
citizen I-ANSWER
may I-ANSWER
rely I-ANSWER
on I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
Directive I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
such I-ANSWER
an I-ANSWER
action I-ANSWER
( I-ANSWER
so I-ANSWER
called I-ANSWER
" I-ANSWER
vertical I-ANSWER
" I-ANSWER
direct I-ANSWER
effect I-ANSWER
) I-ANSWER
. O

So O
, O
in O
Pubblico O
Ministero O
v O
Ratti O
because O
the O
Italian O
government O
had O
failed O
to O
implement O
a B-ANSWER
Directive I-ANSWER
73/173 I-ANSWER
/ I-ANSWER
EEC I-ANSWER
on I-ANSWER
packaging I-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
labelling I-ANSWER
solvents I-ANSWER
by I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
deadline I-ANSWER
, O
it O
was O
estopped O
from O
enforcing O
a O
conflicting O
national O
law O
from O
1963 O
against O
Mr O
Ratti O
's O
solvent O
and O
varnish O
business O
. O

A O
member O
state O
could O
" O
not O
rely O
, O
as O
against O
individuals O
, O
on O
its O
own O
failure O
to O
perform O
the O
obligations O
which O
the O
Directive O
entails O
. O

" O
Second O
, O
a B-ANSWER
citizen I-ANSWER
or I-ANSWER
company I-ANSWER
can I-ANSWER
invoke I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
Directive I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
just I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
dispute I-ANSWER
with I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
public I-ANSWER
authority I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
but I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
dispute I-ANSWER
with I-ANSWER
another I-ANSWER
citizen I-ANSWER
or I-ANSWER
company I-ANSWER
. O

So O
, O
in O
CIA O
Security O
v O
Signalson O
and O
Securitel O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
business O
called O
CIA O
Security O
could O
defend O
itself O
from O
allegations O
by O
competitors O
that O
it O
had O
not O
complied O
with O
a O
Belgian O
decree O
from O
1991 O
about O
alarm O
systems O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
it O
had O
not O
been O
notified O
to O
the O
Commission O
as O
a O
Directive O
required O
. O

Third O
, O
if O
a O
Directive O
gives O
expression O
to O
a O
" O
general O
principle O
" O
of O
EU O
law O
, O
it B-ANSWER
can I-ANSWER
be I-ANSWER
invoked I-ANSWER
between I-ANSWER
private I-ANSWER
non I-ANSWER
- I-ANSWER
state I-ANSWER
parties I-ANSWER
before I-ANSWER
its I-ANSWER
deadline I-ANSWER
for I-ANSWER
implementation I-ANSWER
. O

This O
follows O
from O
Kücükdeveci O
v O
Swedex O
GmbH O
& O
Co O
KG O
where O
the O
German O
Civil O
Code O
§ O
622 O
stated O
that O
the O
years O
people O
worked O
under O
the O
age O
of O
25 O
would O
not O
count O
towards O
the O
increasing O
statutory O
notice O
before O
dismissal O
. O

Ms O
Kücükdeveci O
worked O
for O
10 B-ANSWER
years I-ANSWER
, O
from O
age O
18 O
to O
28 O
, O
for O
Swedex O
GmbH B-ANSWER
& I-ANSWER
Co I-ANSWER
KG I-ANSWER
before O
her O
dismissal O
. O

She O
claimed O
that O
the O
law O
not O
counting O
her O
years O
under O
age O
25 O
was O
unlawful O
age O
discrimination O
under O
the O
Employment O
Equality O
Framework O
Directive O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
the O
Directive O
could O
be O
relied O
on O
by O
her O
because O
equality O
was O
also O
a O
general O
principle O
of O
EU O
law O
. O

Third O
, O
if O
the O
defendant O
is O
an O
emanation O
of O
the O
state O
, O
even O
if O
not O
central O
government O
, O
it O
can O
still O
be O
bound O
by O
Directives O
. O

In O
Foster O
v O
British O
Gas O
plc O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Mrs O
Foster O
was O
entitled O
to O
bring O
a O
sex O
discrimination O
claim O
against O
her O
employer O
, O
British B-ANSWER
Gas I-ANSWER

, O
which O
made O
women B-ANSWER
retire I-ANSWER
at I-ANSWER
age I-ANSWER
60 I-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
men I-ANSWER
at I-ANSWER
65 I-ANSWER
, O
if O
( O

) O
pursuant O
to O
a O

measure O
, O

( O

) O
it O
provided O
a O
public O
service O
, O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
had O
special O
powers O
. O

This O
could O
also O
be O
true O
if O
the O
enterprise O
is O
privatised O
, O
as O
it O
was O
held O
with O
a O
water O
company O
that O
was O
responsible O
for O
basic O
water O
provision O
. O

Fourth O
, O
national B-ANSWER
courts I-ANSWER
have O
a O
duty O
to O
interpret O
domestic O
law O
" O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
wording O
and O
purpose O
of O
the O
directive O
" O
. O

Textbooks O
( O
though O
not O
the O
Court O
itself O
) O
often O
called O
this O
" O
indirect O
effect O
" O
. O

In O
Marleasing O
SA O
v O
La O
Comercial O
SA O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
Spanish O
Court O
had O
to O
interpret O
its O
general O
Civil O
Code O
provisions O
, O
on O
contracts O
lacking O
cause O
or O
defrauding O
creditors O
, O
to O
conform O
with O
the O
First O
Company O
Law O
Directive O
article O
11 O
, O
that O
required O
incorporations B-ANSWER
would I-ANSWER
only I-ANSWER
be I-ANSWER
nullified I-ANSWER
for I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
fixed I-ANSWER
list I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
reasons I-ANSWER
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
quickly O
acknowledged O
that B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
duty I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
interpretation I-ANSWER
can I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
contradict I-ANSWER
plain I-ANSWER
words I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
national I-ANSWER
statute I-ANSWER
. O

But O
, O
fifth O
, O
if O
a O
member O
state O
has O
failed O
to O
implement O
a O
Directive O
, O
a O
citizen O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
bring O
claims O
against O
other O
non O
- O
state O
parties O
, O
but O
can O
sue O
the O
member O
state O
itself O
for O
failure O
to O
implement O
the O
law O
. O

So O
, O
in O
Francovich O
v O
Italy O
, O
the O
Italian O
government O
had O
failed B-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER
set I-ANSWER
up I-ANSWER
an I-ANSWER
insurance I-ANSWER
fund I-ANSWER
for I-ANSWER
employees I-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER
claim I-ANSWER
unpaid I-ANSWER
wages I-ANSWER
if I-ANSWER
their I-ANSWER
employers I-ANSWER
had I-ANSWER
gone I-ANSWER
insolvent I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
as I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
Insolvency I-ANSWER
Protection I-ANSWER
Directive I-ANSWER
required I-ANSWER
. O

Francovich O
, O
the O
former O
employee O
of O
a O
bankrupt O
Venetian O
firm O
, O
was O
therefore O
allowed O
to O
claim O
6 B-ANSWER
million I-ANSWER
Lira I-ANSWER
from O
the O
Italian O
government O
in O
damages O
for O
his O
loss O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
if O
a O
Directive O
would O
confer O
identifiable O
rights O
on O
individuals O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
causal O
link O
between O
a O
member O
state O
's O
violation O
of O
EU O
and O
a O
claimant O
's O
loss O
, O
damages O
must O
be O
paid O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
incompatible O
law O
is O
an O
Act O
of O
Parliament O
is O
no O
defence O
. O

The O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
are O
rules O
of O
law O
which O
have O
been O
developed O
by O
the B-ANSWER
European I-ANSWER
Court I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
Justice I-ANSWER
that O
constitute O
unwritten B-ANSWER
rules I-ANSWER
which O
are O
not O
expressly O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
treaties O
but O
which O
affect O
how O
European O
Union O
law O
is O
interpreted O
and O
applies O
. O

In O
formulating O
these O
principles O
, O
the O
courts O
have O
drawn O
on O
a B-ANSWER
variety I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
sources I-ANSWER
, O
including O
: O
public O
international O
law O
and O
legal O
doctrines O

Proportionality O

of O
European O
Union O
law O
by O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
since B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
1950s I-ANSWER
. O

According O
to O
the O
general O
principle O
of O
proportionality O
the B-ANSWER
lawfulness I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
an I-ANSWER
action I-ANSWER
depends I-ANSWER
on I-ANSWER
whether I-ANSWER
it I-ANSWER

appropriate I-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
necessary I-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER

the I-ANSWER

When O

any O

to O
the O

The O
principle O

It O
is O
an O

international B-ANSWER

public I-ANSWER

, O
which O
predates O
European O

As O
a O
general O

in O
European O

it O
means O
that O
the O

The O
adoption O

a B-ANSWER
proper I-ANSWER

Legislation O

In O
European O

law O
the O
general O

, O
i.e. O

The O

a O

The O

Fundamental O

as O
in O

were O
first O
recognised O
by O
the O
European O
Court O

in B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
late I-ANSWER

As O
such O
the O
European O
Court O

inspiration O

the I-ANSWER
constitutional I-ANSWER
traditions I-ANSWER
common I-ANSWER

the I-ANSWER

Therefore O
, O
the O
European O

can O
not O
uphold O

The O

None B-ANSWER
of O

At O
the O

the O
only O
concern O
was O
that O

hence O
the O

The O

recognised O
fundamental B-ANSWER

as I-ANSWER
general I-ANSWER

as I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER

the I-ANSWER

ever O

In O
1999 B-ANSWER
the O
European O
Council O
set O
up O
a O
body O
tasked O
with O
drafting O
a O
European O
Charter O

which O
could O
form O

as O

its O

The O
Charter O

Fundamental O

of O
the O
European O

draws O
a O
list O

from O
the O

the B-ANSWER

According O

reduce B-ANSWER

It O
was O
originally O
theorised O
that O
a O
free B-ANSWER
trade I-ANSWER
area O
had B-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
tendency I-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER
give I-ANSWER
way I-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
customs I-ANSWER
union I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
which O
led O
to O
a O
common O

then O
monetary O
union O
, O
then O
union O
of O

eventually O
a O
full O

characteristic O
of O
a O

In O
Europe O
, O
however O
, O
those O
stages O
were O
considerably O
mixed O
, O
and O
it O
remains O
unclear O
whether O
the O
" O
endgame O
" O
should O
be O
the O
same O
as O
a O
state O
, O
traditionally O
understood O

In O
practice O
free O
trade O

without O

within O

( O
particularly O
big O

much O
more O
than O
others O

will O
burden O

The O
Treaty O
on O
the O
Functioning O
of O
the O
European O

articles O
28 O
to O
37 O
establish O
the O
principle O
of O
free O
movement O
of O
goods O
in O
the O
EU O
, O
while O
articles O
45 O
to O
66 O
require O
free O
movement O
of O
persons O
, O
services O
and O
capital O
. O

These O
so O
- O
called O
" O
four O
freedoms O
" O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
inhibited O
by O
physical O
barriers O
( O
e.g. O
customs O

, O
technical O
barriers O
( O
e.g. O
differing O

standards O
) O
and O
fiscal O
barriers O
( O
e.g. O
different O
Value O

. O

The O
tension O
in O
the O
law O
is O
that O
the O
free O
movement O
and O
trade O
is O
not O
supposed O
to O
spill O
over O
into O
a O
licence O
for O
unrestricted O

The O
Treaties O
limit O
free B-ANSWER
trade I-ANSWER

health O
, O

, O

, O
and O
environmental O

Increasingly O
the B-ANSWER
Court I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
Justice I-ANSWER
has O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
the O
specific O
goals O
of O
free O
trade O
are O
underpinned O
by O
the O
general O
aims O
of O
the O
treaty O
for O

of O
people O
's O
well O

Free O
movement O
of O

within O
the O
European O

is O
achieved O
by O
a B-ANSWER
customs I-ANSWER
union I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER

the I-ANSWER
principle I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
non I-ANSWER
- I-ANSWER
discrimination I-ANSWER
. O

The O
EU O
manages O
imports B-ANSWER

member O
states O
, O
duties B-ANSWER
between O
member O
states O
are O
prohibited O
, O
and O
imports O
circulate O
freely O
. O

In O
addition O
under O
the O
Treaty O
on O
the O
Functioning O
of O
the O
European O
Union O
article O
34 O
, O
‘ O
Quantitative O
restrictions O
on O
imports O
and O
all O
measures O
having O
equivalent O
effect O
shall O
be O
prohibited O
between O
Member O
States O
’ O
. O

In O
Procureur O
du O
Roi O
v O
Dassonville O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
this O
rule O
meant O
all O
" O
trading O
rules O
" O
that O
are O
" O
enacted O
by O
Member O
States O
" O
which O
could O
hinder O
trade O
" O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
, O
actually O
or O
potentially O
" O
would O
be O
caught O
by O
article O
34 O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
a O
Belgian O
law O
requiring O
Scotch O
whisky O
imports O
to O
have O
a O
certificate O
of O
origin O
was O
unlikely O
to O
be O
lawful O
. O

It O
discriminated O
against O
parallel B-ANSWER
importers I-ANSWER
like I-ANSWER
Mr I-ANSWER
Dassonville I-ANSWER
, O
who O
could O
not O
get O
certificates O
from O
authorities O
in O
France O
, O
where O
they O
bought O
the O
Scotch O
. O

This O
" O
wide O
test O
" O
, O
to O
determine O
what O
could O
potentially O
be O
an O
unlawful O
restriction O
on O
trade O
, O
applies O
equally O
to O
actions O
by O
quasi O
- O
government O
bodies O
, O
such O
as O
the O
former O
" O
Buy O
Irish O
" O
company O
that O
had O
government O
appointees O
. O

It O
also O
means O
states O
can O
be O
responsible O
for O
private B-ANSWER
actors I-ANSWER
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Commission B-ANSWER
v I-ANSWER
France I-ANSWER
French I-ANSWER
farmer O
vigilantes O
were O
continually O
sabotaging O
shipments O
of O
Spanish O
strawberries O
, O
and O
even O
Belgian O
tomato O
imports O
. O

France O
was O
liable O
for O
these O
hindrances O
to O
trade O
because O
the O
authorities O
‘ O
manifestly O
and O
persistently O
abstained O
' O
from O
preventing O
the O
sabotage O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
if O
a O
member O
state O
has O
laws O
or O
practices O
that O
directly O
discriminate O
against O
imports O
( O
or O
exports O
under O
TFEU O
article O
35 O
) O
then O
it O
must O
be O
justified O
under O
article O
36 O
. O

The O
justifications O
include O
public O
morality O
, O
policy O
or O
security O
, O
" O
protection O
of O
health O
and O
life O
of O
humans O
, O
animals O
or O
plants O
" O
, O
" O
national O
treasures O
" O
of O
" O
artistic O
, O
historic O
or O
archaeological O
value O
" O
and O
" O
industrial O
and O
commercial O
property O
. O
" O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
not O
clearly O
listed O
, O
environmental O
protection O
can O
justify O
restrictions O
on O
trade O
as O
an O
overriding O
requirement O
derived O
from O
TFEU O
article O
11 O
. O

More O
generally O
, O
it O
has O
been O
increasingly O
acknowledged O
that O
fundamental O
human O
rights O
should O
take O
priority O
over O
all O
trade O
rules O
. O

So O
, O
in O
Schmidberger O
v O
Austria O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Austria O
did O
not O
infringe O
article O
34 O
by O
failing O
to O
ban O

Although O

prevented O
from O

the O
Court O

Justice O
reasoned O
that O
freedom O

is O
one O
of O
the O
‘ O
fundamental O
pillars O
of O
a O
democratic O
society O
’ O
, O
against O
which O
the O
free O
movement O
of O
goods O
had O
to O
be O
balanced O
, O
and O
was O
probably O
subordinate O
. O

If O
a O

does O
appeal O

the O
article O
36 O
justification O
, O
the O
measures O
it O
takes O
have O
to O
be O
applied O
proportionately O

This O
means O
the O
rule O
must O
be O
pursue O
a O
legitimate O
aim O
and O
( O

) O
be O
suitable O
to O
achieve O
the O
aim O

( O

be O

so O
that O
a O

measure O
could O
not O
achieve O
the O

result O

and O
( O

) O
be O
reasonable O
in O
balancing O
the O
interests O

Often O
rules O

may O
have O
a O

For O
such O

( O

measures O
the O
Court O

developed O
more O

to O

The B-ANSWER
Court I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
Justice I-ANSWER
rejected O
the O
German O
government O
's O
arguments O
that O
the O
measure O
proportionately O
protected O
public O
health O
under O
TFEU O
article O
36 O
, O
because O
stronger O

were O
available O
and O
adequate O
labelling O
would O
be O
enough O
for O
consumers O
to O
understand O
what O
they O
bought O

This O
rule O
primarily O
applies O
to O
requirements O

In O
Walter O
Rau O

PVBA O
the O
Court O

found O
that O
a O
Belgian O
law O
requiring O
all O
margarine O
to O
be O
in O
cube O
shaped O
packages O
infringed O
article O
34 O
, O
and O
was O
not O
justified O
by O
the O
pursuit O
of O
consumer O
protection O
. O

The O
argument O
that O
Belgians O
would O
believe O
it O
was O
butter O
if O
it O
was O
not O
cube O
shaped O

was O
disproportionate O
: O
it O
would O
" O
considerably O
exceed O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
object O
in O
view O
" O
and O
labelling O
would O
protect O
consumers O
" O
just O
as O

. O

In O
a O
2003 B-ANSWER
case O
, O
Commission O
v O
Italy O
Italian O
law O
required O
that O
cocoa O

could O
not O
be O
labelled O
as O
" O

" O

It O
had O
to O

. O

All O
Italian O
chocolate O
was O
made O
from O
cocoa B-ANSWER
butter I-ANSWER
alone O
, O
but O
British O
, O
Danish O
and O
Irish O
manufacturers O
used O
other O
vegetable O

. O

They O
claimed O
the O
law O
infringed O
article O
34 O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
low O
content O
of O
vegetable O
fat O
did B-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
justify I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
" I-ANSWER
chocolate I-ANSWER

. O

This O
was O
derogatory O
in O
the O
consumers O
' O
eyes O
. O

A O
‘ O
neutral O
and O
objective O
statement O
’ O
was O
enough O
to O
protect O
consumers O
. O

If O
member O
states O
place O
considerable O
obstacles O
on O
the O
use O
of O
a O
product O

this O
can O
also O
infringe O

So O
, O
in O
a O
2009 O
case O
, O
Commission O
v O
Italy O
, O
the O
Court O

Justice O
held O
that O
an O
Italian O
law O
prohibiting O
motorcycles B-ANSWER
or I-ANSWER
mopeds I-ANSWER
pulling I-ANSWER

infringed O
article O
34 O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
law O
applied O
neutrally O
to O
everyone O
, O
but O
disproportionately O
affected O
importers O
, O
because O
Italian O
companies O
did O
not O
make O
trailers O
. O

This O
was O
not O
a O
product O
requirement O
, O
but O
the O
Court O
reasoned O
that O
the O
prohibition O
would O
deter O
people O
from O
buying O
it O

: O
it O
would O
have O
" O
a O
considerable O
influence O
on O
the O
behaviour O
of O
consumers O
" O
that O
" O
affects O
the O
access O
of O
that O
product O
to O
the O
market O
" O
. O

It O
would O
require O
justification O
under O
article O
36 O
, O
or O
as O
a O
mandatory O
requirement O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
product O
requirements O
or O
other O
laws O
that O
hinder O
market O
access O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
developed O
a O
presumption O
that O
" O
selling B-ANSWER

" O
would O
be O
presumed O
to O
not O
fall O
into O
TFEU O
article O
34 O
, O
if O
they O
applied O
equally O
to O
all O
sellers O
, O
and O
affected O
them O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
in O
fact O
. O

In O
Keck B-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
Mithouard I-ANSWER
two O
importers O
claimed O
that O
their O

under O
a O
French O
competition O
law O
, O
which O
prevented O
them O
selling O
Picon O
beer O
under O
wholesale O
price O
, O
was O
unlawful O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
law O
was O
to B-ANSWER
prevent I-ANSWER
cut I-ANSWER
throat I-ANSWER
competition I-ANSWER
, I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER

. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
, O
as O
" O
in O

in O

" O
it O

it O

the O

, O
and O
so O
did O
not O

Selling O

have O
an O

the O

emphasised O
that O

In O

that O

in O
Van O

a O
Dutch O
lawyer O
moved O

he B-ANSWER

The O

held O
that O
the O

applied O

it O
was O
directly O

and O
the O
rule O
was O
probably O

: O
having O
an O

be O

pursue O
the O

aim O

The O
Court O

has O
held O
that O
secondary B-ANSWER

falls O
outside O

scope O

the O

In O
Geraets O
- O
Smits O
v O

Stichting O

Mrs O
Geraets O

Smits O
claimed O
she O
should O
be O
reimbursed O
by O
Dutch O
social O
insurance O
for O
costs O
of O
receiving O
treatment O
in O
Germany O
. O

The O
Dutch O
health O
authorities O
regarded O
the B-ANSWER
treatment I-ANSWER
unnecessary O
, O
so O
she O
argued O
this O
restricted O
the O
freedom O
( O
of O
the O
German O
health O
clinic O
) O
to O
provide O

. O

Several O
governments O
submitted O
that O
hospital B-ANSWER
services I-ANSWER

not I-ANSWER
be I-ANSWER
regarded I-ANSWER

economic I-ANSWER
, O
and O
should O
not O
fall O
within O
article O
56 O
. O

But O
the O
Court O

held O
health O

was O
a O
" O
service O
" O
even O
though O
the O
government O
( O
rather O
than O
the O
service O
recipient O
) O
paid O
for O
the O

National O
authorities O
could O
be O
justified O
in O
refusing O
to O
reimburse O
patients O
for O
medical O
services O
abroad O
if O
the O
health O
care O
received O
at O
home O
was O
without O
undue O
delay O
, O
and O
it O
followed O
" O
international O
medical O
science O
" O
on O
which O
treatments O
counted O
as O
normal O
and O
necessary O
. O

The O
Court O
requires O
that O
the O
individual O
circumstances O
of O
a O
patient O
justify O
waiting O
lists O
, O
and O
this O
is O
also O
true O
in O
the O
context O
of O

because O

were O
less O

the O

This O
approach O
was O
criticised O
as O
potentially O
opening O
the O

competition O

and O
a O

Similarly O
in O

the O
Court O

held O
that O

denial O

too O

it O

an O

of O
the O

However O
, O
in O
Cartesio O
Oktató O

the O
Court O

affirmed O
again O
that O

, O
they O
are O
in O
principle O
subject O
to O
any O
rules O
for O
formation O
that O
a O

wishes O

This O
meant O
that O
the O

could O
prevent O
a O

shifting O
its O

to O
Italy O
while O
it O
still O

Thus O
, O
the O
court O
draws O
a O
distinction O
between O
the O
right O
of O
establishment O
for O
foreign O
companies O
( O

the O

cydippid O
ctenophores O
are O
typically O
fringed O
with O
tentilla B-ANSWER
( O
" O
little O
tentacles O
" O
) O
, O
although O
a O
few O
genera O
have O
simple O
tentacles O
without O
these O
sidebranches O
. O

The O
tentacles O
and O
tentilla O
are O
densely O
covered O
with O
microscopic O
colloblasts O
that O
capture O
prey O
by O
sticking O
to O
it O
. O

Colloblasts O
are O
specialized B-ANSWER
mushroom I-ANSWER

shaped I-ANSWER
cells I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
outer I-ANSWER
layer I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
epidermis I-ANSWER
, O
and O
have O
three B-ANSWER
main O
components O
: O
a O
domed O
head O
with O
vesicles B-ANSWER
( O
chambers O
) O
that O
contain O
adhesive B-ANSWER
; O
a O
stalk O
that O
anchors O
the O
cell O
in O
the O
lower O
layer O
of O
the O
epidermis O
or O
in O
the O
mesoglea O
; O
and O
a O
spiral O
thread O
that O
coils O
round O
the O
stalk O
and O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
head O
and O
to O
the O
root O
of O
the O
stalk O
. O

The O
function O
of O
the O
spiral O
thread O
is O
uncertain O
, O
but O
it O
may O
absorb O
stress O
when O
prey O
tries O
to O
escape O
, O
and O
thus O
prevent O
the O
collobast O
from O
being O
torn O

In O
addition O
to O
colloblasts O
, O
members O
of O
the O
genus O
Haeckelia O

The O
tentilla O
of O
Euplokamis O
differ O
significantly O
from O
those O

a O

unknown O
in O
the O
phylum O

; O
and O
they O
are O
coiled O
when O
relaxed O
, O
while O
the O
tentilla O
of O
all O
other O
known O
ctenophores O
elongate O
when O

Euplokamis O
' O
tentilla O
have O
three B-ANSWER
types I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
movement I-ANSWER
that O
are O
used O
in O
capturing B-ANSWER
prey I-ANSWER
: O
they O
may O
flick O
out O
very O
quickly O
( O
in O
40 O

) O
; O
they O
can O
wriggle O
, O
which O
may O
lure O
prey O
by O
behaving O
like O
small O
planktonic O
worms O
; O
and O
they O
coil O
round O
prey O
. O

The O
unique O
flicking O
is O
an O
uncoiling O
movement O
powered O
by O
contraction O
of O
the O
striated O
muscle O
. O

The O
wriggling O
motion O
is O
produced O
by O
smooth O
muscles O
, O
but O
of O
a O
highly O
specialized O
type O
. O

Coiling O
around O
prey O
is O
accomplished O
largely O
by O
the O
return O
of O
the O
tentilla O
to O
their O
inactive O
state O
, O
but O
the O
coils O
may O
be O
tightened O

supported O
ctenophores O

the O

all B-ANSWER
other I-ANSWER
animals I-ANSWER

This O
position O
would O
suggest O
that O
neural O

were O
either O
lost O

major O
animal O
lineages O

that O

evolved O

However O

other O

have O
argued O
that O
the O
placement O

is O
a O
statistical O
anomaly O
caused O
by O
the O

that O
Porifera B-ANSWER

Ctenophores O

Since O
all O
modern O
ctenophores O
except O
the O
beroids B-ANSWER
have O
cydippid O

it O
has O
widely O
been O
assumed O
that O
their O
last O

also O
resembled O
cydippids O

having O
an O

a O

Richard B-ANSWER
Harbison I-ANSWER
's O
purely B-ANSWER
morphological I-ANSWER
analysis O
in O
1985 O
concluded O
that O
the O
cydippids O
are B-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
monophyletic I-ANSWER
, O
in O
other O
words O
do O
not O
contain O
all O

only O
the O
descendants O
of O
a O
single O
common O
ancestor O
that O
was O
itself O
a O
cydippid O
. O

Instead O
he O
found O
that O
various O
cydippid O
families O
were O
more O
similar O
to O
members B-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
other I-ANSWER
ctenophore I-ANSWER
orders I-ANSWER
than O
to O
other O
cydippids O
. O

He O
also O
suggested O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
either O
cydippid O
- O
like O

beroid O

A O

26 B-ANSWER

4 O
recently O

confirmed O
that O
the O
cydippids O
are O
not O
monophyletic B-ANSWER
and O
concluded O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
cydippid O
- O
like O
. O

It O
also O
found O
that O
the O
genetic O
differences O
between O
these O
species O
were O
very O
small O
– O
so O
small O
that O
the O
relationships O
between O
the O
Lobata O
, O
Cestida O
and O
Thalassocalycida O
remained O
uncertain O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
relatively O
recent O
, O
and O
perhaps O
was O
lucky O

to O
survive O
the O

When O
the O
analysis O
was O
broadened O
to O
include O
representatives O
of O
other O
phyla O

it O
concluded O
that O
cnidarians O
are O
probably O
more O
closely O
related O
to O
bilaterians O
than O
either O
group O
is O
to O
ctenophores O

that O
this O

Some O

used O

the O

its O

The O
simplicity O

Because O

Before O
Thoreau B-ANSWER
’s O
imprisonment B-ANSWER
, O
when O
a O
confused O
taxman O
had O
wondered O
aloud O
about O
how O
to O
handle O
his O
refusal B-ANSWER
to I-ANSWER
pay I-ANSWER
, O
Thoreau B-ANSWER
had O
advised O
, O
“ B-ANSWER
Resign I-ANSWER
. I-ANSWER
” I-ANSWER

If O
a O
man O
chose O
to O
be O
an O
agent O
of O
injustice O
, O
then O
Thoreau B-ANSWER
insisted O
on O
confronting O
him O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
making O
a O
choice O
. O

But O
if O
government O
is O
“ O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
people O
, O
” O
as O
it O
is O
often O
called O
, O
should O
n’t O
that O
voice O
be O
heeded O
? O

Thoreau O
admits O
that O
government O
may O
express O
the B-ANSWER
will I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
majority I-ANSWER
but O
it O
may O
also O
express O
nothing O
more O
than O
the B-ANSWER
will I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
elite I-ANSWER
politicians I-ANSWER
. O

Even O
a O
good O
form O
of O
government O
is O
“ O
liable O
to O
be O
abused O
and O
perverted O
before O
the O
people O
can O
act O
through O
it O
. O
” O

Moreover O
, O
even O
if O
a O
government O
did O
express O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
people O
, O
this O
fact O
would O
not O
compel O
the O
obedience O
of O
individuals B-ANSWER
who O
disagree O
with O
what O
is O
being O
said O
. O

The B-ANSWER
majority I-ANSWER
may I-ANSWER
be I-ANSWER
powerful I-ANSWER
but I-ANSWER
it I-ANSWER
is I-ANSWER
not I-ANSWER
necessarily I-ANSWER
right I-ANSWER
. O

What O
, O
then O
, O
is O
the O
proper O
relationship O
between O
the O
individual O
and O
the O
government O
? O

Some O
theories O

hold O
that B-ANSWER

argues O
that O

it O

that I-ANSWER
conflict I-ANSWER

we O
might O

why O

take O

rather O
than O
simply O
covert B-ANSWER
lawbreaking I-ANSWER

One O
theory O
is O
that O

may O
be O
helpful O

any B-ANSWER

it I-ANSWER

It O
has O
also O
been O

During O

A B-ANSWER
construction I-ANSWER

is O
a O
complex O
net O
of O

legal O
obligations O
, O
each O
of O
which O
all O

must O
carefully O

A B-ANSWER
contract I-ANSWER
is O
the O

it O
is O

The O
time O

in O

means O
that B-ANSWER

An O
important O
factor O
in O
the O
creation O

optional B-ANSWER
education I-ANSWER

generally O
receive O
much O
lower B-ANSWER

The O
justification O
for O
this O
is O
that O
a O
lack O
of O

leads O
directly O
to O
lower B-ANSWER

Conversely O
, O

This O
decrease B-ANSWER

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
a O

Robert B-ANSWER
Nozick I-ANSWER

However O
, O
Nozick O
recognized O

not O
because O

John O

Some O
see O
Rawls O

Some O
bacteria O
form O

This O
is O
called O
antigenic B-ANSWER

An O
example O
is O
HIV B-ANSWER
, O
which O
mutates O

the O
proteins O
on O
its O
viral O

that O
are O
essential O
for O

are O
constantly O
changing O

These O
frequent B-ANSWER
changes I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
antigens I-ANSWER
may O
explain O
the O
failures O
of O
vaccines O

The O
parasite O
Trypanosoma B-ANSWER
brucei I-ANSWER
uses O
a O
similar O
strategy O
, O
constantly O
switching O
one O
type O
of O

Masking O
antigens B-ANSWER
with O

is O
another O
common O
strategy O
for O
avoiding O
detection O
by O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

In O
HIV O
, O
the O
envelope O
that O
covers O
the O
virion O
is O
formed O
from O
the O
outermost O
membrane O
of O
the O
host O
cell O
; O
such O
" O
self O

viruses O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
immune O

Another O
important O
role O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
is O
to O
identify B-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
eliminate I-ANSWER
tumors I-ANSWER
. O

This O
is O
called O
immune B-ANSWER
surveillance I-ANSWER
. O

The O
transformed O
cells O
of O
tumors O
express O
antigens B-ANSWER
that O
are O
not O
found O
on O
normal O
cells O
. O

To O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
these O
antigens O
appear O
foreign O
, O
and O
their O
presence O
causes O
immune O
cells O
to O
attack O
the O
transformed O
tumor O
cells O
. O

The O
antigens O
expressed O
by O
tumors O
have O
several O
sources O
; O
some O
are O
derived O
from O
oncogenic B-ANSWER
viruses I-ANSWER
like O
human B-ANSWER
papillomavirus I-ANSWER
, O
which O
causes O
cervical O
cancer O

while O
others O
are O
the O
organism O

that O
occur O
at O
low O
levels O
in O
normal O
cells O
but O
reach O
high O
levels O
in O
tumor O
cells O
. O

One O
example O
is O
an O
enzyme O
called O
tyrosinase B-ANSWER
that O
, O
when O
expressed O
at O
high O
levels O
, O
transforms B-ANSWER
certain I-ANSWER
skin I-ANSWER
cells I-ANSWER
( I-ANSWER
e.g. I-ANSWER
melanocytes I-ANSWER
) I-ANSWER
into I-ANSWER
tumors I-ANSWER
called O
melanomas B-ANSWER
. O

A O
third O
possible O
source O
of O
tumor O
antigens O
are O
proteins O
normally O
important O
for O
regulating O
cell O
growth O
and O
survival O
, O
that O
commonly O
mutate O
into O
cancer O
inducing O
molecules O
called O
oncogenes B-ANSWER
. O

Larger O
drugs O
( O
> B-ANSWER

Da I-ANSWER
) O
can O
provoke O
a O
neutralizing B-ANSWER
immune O
response O
, O
particularly O
if O
the O
drugs O
are O
administered O
repeatedly O
, O
or O
in O
larger O

This O
limits B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
effectiveness I-ANSWER

drugs O
based O
on O
larger O
peptides O
and O
proteins O
( O
which O
are O
typically O
larger O

Da O
) O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
drug O
itself O
is O
not O
immunogenic O

Indeed O

If O

the O
probability O

the I-ANSWER
agreement I-ANSWER

Each O

day O
, O
normally O
at O
5 B-ANSWER
pm I-ANSWER
, O
MSPs O
decide O
on O
all O
the O
motions B-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
amendments I-ANSWER
that O
have O
been O
moved O
that O
day O
. O

This O
" B-ANSWER
Decision I-ANSWER
Time I-ANSWER
" I-ANSWER
is O
heralded O
by O
the O
sounding O
of O
the O
division O
bell O
, O
which O
is O
heard O
throughout O
the O
Parliamentary O
campus O
and O
alerts O
MSPs O
who O
are O
not O
in O
the O
chamber O
to O
return O
and O
vote B-ANSWER
. O

At O
Decision B-ANSWER
Time I-ANSWER
, O
the O
Presiding O
Officer O
puts O
questions O
on O
the O
motions O
and O
amendments O
by O
reading O
out O
the O
name O
of O
the O
motion O
or O
amendment O
as O
well O
as O
the O
proposer O
and O
asking O
" O
Are O
we O
all O
agreed O
? O
" O
, O
to O
which O
the O
chamber O
first O
votes O
orally O
. O

If O
there O
is O
audible O
dissent O
, O
the O
Presiding O
Officer O
announces O
" O
There B-ANSWER
will I-ANSWER
be I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
division I-ANSWER
" O
and O
members O
vote O
by O
means O
of O
electronic B-ANSWER
consoles I-ANSWER
on I-ANSWER
their I-ANSWER
desks I-ANSWER
. O

Each O
MSP O
has O
a O
unique O
access O
card O
with O
a O
microchip O
which O
, O
when O
inserted O
into O
the O
console O
, O
identifies O
them O
and O
allows O
them O
to O
vote O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
outcome O
of O
each B-ANSWER
division I-ANSWER
is O
known O
in O
seconds B-ANSWER
. O

The O
outcome B-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
most I-ANSWER
votes I-ANSWER
can O
be O
predicted O
beforehand O
since O
political B-ANSWER
parties I-ANSWER
normally O
instruct O
members O
which O
way O
to O
vote O
. O

Parties O
entrust O
some O
MSPs O
, O
known O
as O
whips B-ANSWER
, O
with O
the O
task O
of O
ensuring O
that O
party O
members O
vote O
according O
to O
the O
party O
line O
. O

MSPs O
do O
not O
tend O
to O
vote O
against O
such O
instructions O
, O
since O
those O
who O
do O
are O
unlikely O
to O
reach O
higher O
political O
ranks O
in O
their O
parties O
. O

Errant O
members O
can O
be O
deselected B-ANSWER
as I-ANSWER
official I-ANSWER
party I-ANSWER
candidates I-ANSWER
during I-ANSWER
future I-ANSWER
elections I-ANSWER
, O
and O
, O
in O
serious O
cases O
, O
may O
be O
expelled O
from O
their O
parties O
outright O
. O

Thus O
, O
as O
with O
many O
Parliaments O
, O
the O
independence O
of O
Members O
of O
the O
Scottish B-ANSWER
Parliament O
tends O
to O
be O

, O
and O
backbench B-ANSWER
rebellions O
by O
members O
who O
are O
discontent O
with O
their O
party O

policies O
are O
rare O
. O

In O
some O
circumstances O
, O
however O
, O
parties O
announce O
" O
free O
votes O
" O
, O
which O
allows O
Members O
to O
vote O
as O
they O
please O
. O

This O

Such O

The O

the I-ANSWER
Scottish I-ANSWER
Parliament I-ANSWER
than I-ANSWER
in I-ANSWER
other I-ANSWER

partly B-ANSWER

the I-ANSWER

of I-ANSWER
backbenchers I-ANSWER

The O
principal B-ANSWER

Islamism B-ANSWER

a O
controversial O
concept O
not O

it O

the O

Robert O

Colonialism O

degree O

Particularly O

Edward O

it O

colonialism O

Orientalism O
, O
as O
theorized O
by O
Edward O

, O
refers O
to O
how O
the O
West O
developed O
an B-ANSWER
imaginative I-ANSWER
geography I-ANSWER
of O
the O
East O
. O

This O
imaginative O
geography O
relies O
on O
an O
essentializing O
discourse O
that O
represents O
neither O
the O

nor O
the O
social O
reality O
of O
the O
East O
. O

Rather O
, O
by O
essentializing O
the O
East O
, O
this O
discourse O
uses O
the O
idea O

the O
West O

" O
there O

in O
the O
East O

This O
difference O
was O
particularly O
apparent O
in O
textual O
and O
visual O
works O
of O
early O
European O
studies O
of O
the O
Orient O
that O
positioned O
the O
East O
as B-ANSWER
irrational I-ANSWER
and I-ANSWER
backward I-ANSWER
in O
opposition O
to O
the O
rational B-ANSWER

progressive I-ANSWER
West O

Defining B-ANSWER
the I-ANSWER
East I-ANSWER
as I-ANSWER
a I-ANSWER
negative I-ANSWER
vision I-ANSWER
of I-ANSWER
itself I-ANSWER
, O
as O
its B-ANSWER
inferior I-ANSWER
, O
not O
only O
increased O
the O
West O

sense O

self O

but O
also O
was O
a O
way O

the O
East O

making O
it O

the O

so O
that O
it O
could O

The O
discourse O
of O
Orientalism B-ANSWER
therefore O
served O
as O
an O
ideological O
justification O
of O
early O
Western O
imperialism O
, O
as O
it O
formed O
a O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
destroyed O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O

Warsaw O
Uprising O
of O
1944 B-ANSWER
. O

After O
the O
war O
, O
the O
new O
communist O
authorities O
of O
Poland O
discouraged O
church O
construction O
and O
only O
a O
small O

were O
rebuilt O

The O
basic O
unit O
of O
territorial O
division O
in O
Poland O
is O
a B-ANSWER
commune I-ANSWER
( O
gmina O
) O
. O

A O
city O
is O
also O
a B-ANSWER
commune I-ANSWER
– O
but O
with O
the O
city B-ANSWER
charter I-ANSWER
. I-ANSWER

Both O
cities O
and O
communes O
are O
governed O
by O
a O
mayor O
– O
but O
in O
the O
communes O
the O
mayor O
is O
vogt O
( O
wójt O
in O
Polish O
) O
, O
however O
in O
the O
cities O
– O
burmistrz O
. O

Some O
bigger O
cities O
obtain O
the O
entitlements O
, O
i.e. O
tasks O
and O
privileges O
, O
which O
are O
possessed O
by O
the O
units O
of O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
territorial O
division O
– O
counties B-ANSWER
or I-ANSWER
powiats I-ANSWER
. O

An O
example O
of O
such O
entitlement O
is O
a O
car O
registration O
: O
a O
gmina O
can O
not O
register O
cars O
, O
this O
is O
a O
powiat O
's O
task O

( O
i.e. O
a O
registration O
number O
depends O
on O
what O
powiat O
a O
car O
had O
been O
registered O
, O
not O
gmina O
) O
. O

In O
this O
case O
we O
say O
about O
city O
county O
or O
powiat O
grodzki O
. O

Such O
cities O
are O
for O
example O
Lublin O
, O
Kraków O
, O
Gdańsk O
, O
Poznań O
. O

In O
Warsaw B-ANSWER
, O
its O
districts O
additionally O
have O
some O
of O
powiat O
's O
entitlements O
– O
like O
already O
mentioned O
car O
registration O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
district O
Wola O
has O
its O
own O
evidence O
and O
the O
district O
Ursynów O
– O
its O
own O
( O
and O
the O
cars O
from O
Wola O
have O
another O
type O
of O
registration O
number O
than O
these O
from O
Ursynów O
) O
. O

But O
for O
instance O
the O
districts O
in O
Kraków B-ANSWER
do O
not O
have O
entitlements O
of O
powiat O
, O
so O
the O
registration O
numbers O
in O
Kraków O
are O
of O
the O
same O
type O
for O
all O
districts O
. O

In O
Aristotle O

Galileo O
realized O

Galileo B-ANSWER
concluded O

This O

contrary O

Aristotle B-ANSWER

For O

Thus O
, O
in O
an O

the O

land O

the O

as O
if O
the O
cannonball O
knows O

travel O

the O

Since O
there O
is O
no O

force O

applied O
on O
the O
cannonball O
as O
it O

, O
the O
only O
conclusion O
left O
is O
that O
the O
cannonball O
continues O
to O
move O
with O
the O

as O
the O
boat O
as O

Thus O

no O

required O

keep O
the O

This O

However O
